The project consists of a single page app which uses Google maps and the Foursquare API to list cafes near Watford, United Kingdom. To create the app the following were used: ReactJS, javaScript, Google Map and Foursquare API, HTML, CSS and responsive design. The app was created using the create-react-app command.

In the app you can search for cafes near Watford on a map from Google, click on markers to receive the detailed address and name of a place from Foursquare.
